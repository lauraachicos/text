To run, simply run "python textParse.py" in the same file path location as where the two example .txt files are saved.
The current execution time is 21.9 seconds.

_____
The function reads in two .txt files and creates a list array from the text that is case-insensitive and ignores punctuation. 
A new vector is created containing all the unique words in the combined texts.
Then there is a corresponding vector with the frequency of unique words from each individual text.
The dot product of these two new vectors is taken to compute the similarity between the texts.
